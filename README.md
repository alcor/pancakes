Pancakes is a an App Script that binds together Google Docs into a nice stack.

A test version [exists here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwMvh831uxceYsK0-PLuhMU3ko8mDsqooQqQfQZU5FtARX6j8BTNrDkREza2Dcv91cH/exec) (note that it'll have big scary permissions you'll have to work around because it's hosted outside your domain.)


### Setting up Pancakes
1. Create a new script at https://script.google.com/
2. Import the files under .gs (This is much easier with [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-apps-script-github/lfjcgcmkmjjlieihflfhjopckgpelofo?hl=en))
3. Add the Google Docs API under Editor > Services
4. Deploy the web interface
5. add ?toc=[GOOGLE_DOC_ID] to the url
